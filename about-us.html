            <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I am a former professional boxer that has now found a new home in web development. I had 9 professional fights in which I only came up short in 1. 
                    Being dedicated to the sport for over 12 years has taught me valuable skills I plan on transfering over to programming. I am a physically active young
                    man and plan on running my first marathon summer 2024. I was born and raised in a mexican culture household making me a native speaker in Spanish.
                    I grew up wanting to be an architect until then adopting boxing to build my self confidence. I am an individual who sticks to something, giving it my full attention
                    and effort. After dealing with a devasting shoulder injury for 3 whole years, after a tragic motorbike accident, I made the decison to step away from my professional 
                    athletic career. Approaching this next step in my professional career with the best of attitude and a student outlook; I am ready to shape and perfect my skills in 
                    software development to bring you, my future client, the best detailed and honest work!</p>
